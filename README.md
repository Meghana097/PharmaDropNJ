# PharmaDrop – Public-Health–Focused Medication Disposal Platform

## 1. What I Made
PharmaDrop is a web application designed to reduce pharmaceutical and antibiotic pollution by making safe medication disposal accessible and routine. The platform helps users locate authorized medication drop-boxes using geolocation and mapping tools and provides a proof-of-concept shipping workflow for users without local access.

## 2. Why I Made It
Improper disposal of medications—especially antibiotics—contributes to environmental contamination and antimicrobial resistance. Although disposal programs exist, they are often difficult to find or poorly publicized. I built PharmaDrop to bridge the gap between public-health infrastructure and everyday user behavior.

## 3. Project Highlight
The most interesting aspect of PharmaDrop was designing a system that balances technical functionality with public accessibility. Rather than focusing on feature density, I prioritized clarity: integrating verified public datasets with mapping APIs while keeping the interface minimal enough for nontechnical users. Building a proof-of-concept shipping workflow also pushed me to think about equity in access when physical drop-boxes are unavailable.

## 4. Maker Context
PharmaDrop was developed independently outside of a laboratory environment using my personal computer. I designed, implemented, tested, and iterated on the full software stack on my own, treating the project as a personal makerspace for civic-focused software engineering.

## 5. My Role
This project was completed independently. I designed the application architecture, implemented the front end and back end, structured the datasets, integrated mapping services, and wrote all public-facing content.

## 6. Tools, Sources & Citations
- **Public Data:** NJ Division of Consumer Affairs – Project Medicine Drop
- **Mapping & Geolocation:** Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap
- **Utilities:** Python Barcode library for generating shipping labels  
All application logic, interface design, and written content were independently created by me.

## 7. What Excites Me About This Work
PharmaDrop reflects my interest in building systems that quietly integrate into daily life. I’m excited by tools that translate public-health policy into practical, user-centered technology that people can actually use.

## 8. Future Directions
- Expansion to national datasets
- User feedback and reporting for outdated locations
- Mobile-first interface
- Partnerships with pharmacies or municipal programs
